# Graphomance
Performance tests for graph databases (e.g. OrientDB, Neo4j, ArangoDB)

# Motivation
The goal for this project is to create consistent set of tests for different graph db providers that are focused on testing specific low level operations (e.g. creating new node, adding new edge) rather than testing real usecases with demo data. 

# Supported database
Graphomance works with following graph databases:
* OrientDB 3.0.x
* Neo4j 3.4.x
* ArangoDB 3.3.x and 3.4
